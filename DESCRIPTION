Description: The Investigation / Study / Assay (ISA) tab-delimited 
	 format is a general purose framework with which to collect and communicate 
	 complex metadata (i.e. sample characteristics, technologies used, type 
	 of measurements made) from experiments employing a combination of 
	 technologies, spanning from traditional approaches to high-throughput
	 techniques. Risatab allows to access metadata/data in ISA-tab format and 
	 build Bioconductor data structures. Currently, data generated from microarray 
	 and flow cytometry assays are supported. The package is extendable, and 
	 efforts are undergoing to support metadata associated to proteomics and 
	 metabolomics-based assays (i.e. mass spectrometry).
