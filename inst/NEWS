NEWS for Risa package

Changes for 1.0.1
------------------
1. The ISAtab-class was extended to include the definition of assay.names, factors, treatments, groups.
2. The previous processAssayXcmsSet method was split into processAssayXcmsSet.1factor and processAssayXcmsSet to consider the first factor only (as it was in the previous definition) or all the factors, respectively.


Changes for 1.0.0
------------------
This is the first release version of the package. It contains functionality to parse ISAtab datasets into an R object from the ISAtab class. It also provides functionality to save the ISA-tab dataset, or each of its individual files. Additionally, it is also possible to update assay files. Currently, metadata associated to proteomics and metabolomics-based assays (i.e. mass spectrometry) can be processed into an xcmsSet object (from the xcms R package).
